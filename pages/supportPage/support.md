If you enjoy and support the blog and work that we’re doing, please consider supporting us with a donation. 



25% of each donation will go towards the maintenance of the Place/Love Project, especially paying our web support and fees. Any extra funds we have after paying these expenses will be thoughtfully put toward expansion of the Project: possibly putting on events or releasing hard copy versions of blog material. Any decision of what to do with these funds will be collaboratively imagined with donors (like you!) and interviewees. 



75% of each donation will go directly towards the following community organizations either fighting against urban displacement or protecting wilderness and natural spaces. Feel free to specify if you’d like the money to go to any one in particular, otherwise we’ll split it amongst them: 

Alliance for the Wild Rockies (AWR) 

Brooklyn Anti-Gentrification Network (BAN) 

Movement for Justice in el Barrio 

Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance 



Please note that the Place/Love Project is not an official, tax-exempt 501(c)(3) non-profit at this time. We cannot provide a tax-deductible receipt for your donation. We recognize there can be a lack of accountability with this status, and so will strive to be very communicative with you about where precisely your money has gone. Thanks for your trust!
