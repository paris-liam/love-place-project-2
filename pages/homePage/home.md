The Place/Love Project is an intervew-based blog focused on our shared physical spaces: our neighborhoods, communities, and wilderness. The following conversations center around two broad questions: What do we value in a Place? How can we achieve those values in our communities? Place/Love is a process of celebration, re-imagining, and everyday action.
