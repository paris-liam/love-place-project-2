The Place/Love Project is a space for the collective imagining of care for our communities, neighborhoods, and shared physical environments - our Places.

Our goal is to provide thought-provoking reading material and resources on these subjects. We feature an ongoing series of [interviews](https://placeloveproject.org/), essays, and book recommendations on topics ranging from mutual aid to local cultural history to neighborhood bars and more.

Feel free to reach out to us with any thoughts at [placeloveproject@gmail.com](mailto:agolio@tulane.edu). And to keep up with new Place/Love content, you can join our weekly mailing list by clicking [here](https://placeloveproject.substack.com/welcome).

## Why Place/Love?

The hope of the Place/Love Project is to document what we value in our communities, and to push the conversation forward on how we think about and engage with our physical and social environments. This is an effort to engage in collective, radical [Placemaking](https://www.pps.org/article/what-is-placemaking) that re-imagines our surroundings centered around those values.

Places are more than just locations - they are also the people and cultures that populate these spaces. Places, and the communities that occupy them, face significant threats, from urban gentrification to the destruction of wilderness. Guided by a commitment to social justice, we believe there is an urgent need for intentional care for Place. We hope to amplify these stories, and in doing so, prompt critical thinking on what makes Places and communities stronger.
