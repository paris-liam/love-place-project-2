The Place/Love Project is a space for the collective imagining of care for our communities, neighborhoods, and shared physical environments - our Places.

At the heart of the Project is an ongoing series of interviews with an ongoing series of people. Each of these interviews becomes a blog post, all of which you can browse [here](https://placeloveproject.org/). The topics vary, from mutual aid to local cultural history to neighborhood bars and more - all of the things that make Places stronger.

There is an urgent need for intentional care for Place - meaning not just a physical location, but also the people and culture that populate it. Our Places face significant threats, from urban gentrification to racist policy to wilderness destruction. In a largely enterprise-driven culture, the responsibility is on us to maintain these Places and communities as we know and love them - and improve upon what we don't love.

The hope of the Place/Love Project is to document what we value in and how we care for communities, neighborhoods, and the environment. This is an effort to engage in collective [Placemaking](https://www.pps.org/article/what-is-placemaking) that re-imagines our surroundings centered around those values - a radical, counter-cultural, and important exercise in a world usually centered around capital instead of community.
