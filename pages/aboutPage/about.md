At the heart of this Project is an ongoing series of blog posts, each one based off of an interview with an ongoing series of people. The interviews are centered around some of the everyday ways that we can care for our communities, neighborhoods, and shared physical spaces. These stories serve two purposes:

First, to celebrate Place - meaning not just a physical location, but also the people and culture that populate it. The focus here is on shared spaces (think parks and libraries, bars and barbershops), and on the local neighborhood where the interviewee lives. The hope here is to document the things we find important about a Place (i.e. social opportunities, access, natural areas), and to therefore engage in collective Placemaking that reimagines our communities centered around those things.

And second, to inspire care for Place. This is an urgent need, as our shared environments face significant threats, from urban gentrification to the destruction of wilderness and natural areas. In a largely enterprise-driven culture, the responsibility is on us to maintain these Places as we know and love them. The real lived experiences and everyday acts of care contained in this blog seek to demonstrate that even seemingly small acts can be radical, counter-cultural, and important.
