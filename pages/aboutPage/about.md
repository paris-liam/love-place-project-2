At the heart of this Project is an ongoing series of blog posts, each one based off of an interview with an ongoing series of people. The interviews are centered around some of the everyday ways that we can care for our communities, neighborhoods, and shared physical spaces. These stories serve two purposes:

First, to celebrate Place - meaning not just a physical location, but also the people and culture that populate it. The focus here is on shared spaces (think parks and libraries, bars and barbershops, streets and trails), and on the local neighborhood where the interviewee lives. The hope here is to document the things we find important about a Place. For instance, we could value a Place for its diversity, for its accessibility, for its social opportunities, or for its natural spaces. This is an effort engage in collective Placemaking that re-imagines our communities centered around those values.

And second, to inspire care for Place. This is an urgent need, as our shared environments face significant and rampant threats, from urban gentrification and displacement to racism and discriminatory policing to the destruction of wilderness. In a largely enterprise-driven culture, the responsibility is on us to maintain these Places and communities as we know and love them - and improve upon what we don't love. The real lived experiences and everyday acts of care contained in this blog vary from supporting local-owned businesses to showing up for protests and demonstrations. All of them seek to demonstrate that even seemingly small acts can be radical, counter-cultural, and important.

Place/Love is foremost a humanist blog, centered around a belief that the world, and the people and creatures that inhabit it, in all of their diversity, are stupefyingly beautiful once we slow down and take a look at it all. But celebration does not have to mean lack of criticism for the injustices that plague our world and communities - quite the opposite. As James Baldwin wrote in his introduction to *Notes of a Native Son*: "I love America more than any other country in the world, and, exactly for this reason, I insist on the right to criticize her perpetually." Place/Love is about both preserving the things that we love in our neighborhoods *and* calling out and having honest conversations about the things that we don't - for it would be a disservice to that love to accept imperfection.
