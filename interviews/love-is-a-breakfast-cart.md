Before our interview, I met John at 10th Ave. and 57th Street, near his apartment building. He
wanted to take me to a tiny Dominican restaurant called Lali: really more of a lunch counter, but
with two tables in the back where we could have our conversation. But first, John took me on a
stroll down 10th Avenue, so that I could see the neighborhood.
It is an interesting little slice of New York: as John was quick to point out, just one block over on
9th there is a totally different feel, and a significantly more advanced stage of gentrification. 9th
has the trendy bars, the clubs and more expensive eateries. Here on 10th, bodegas and
holes-in-the-wall still rule… for now. Lali is only ten blocks from the mammoth new luxury
housing and retail development Hudson Yards (which he and I share a great distaste for), and
the area is quickly changing. Talking with John about the delis he frequents on 10th, his
memories of different stops off the 7 train, and the dueling piano bar he likes to go to (Bar Nine),
it’s clear that he seeks out lively, authentic Places, full of small businesses and people who
know each other's names. Our destination, Lali, was no different - he doesn’t want it to go.
John is a life-long resident of New York City, growing up in Queens, going to high school on the
Upper East Side, college in the Bronx, and now living in a corner of Hell’s Kitchen. John knows
NYC as well as just about anybody (for him, it’s a labor of love), and knows what he values in a
neighborhood. I am reminded here of the concept of [Placemaking], an act of imagining what
shared space could be when realigned to reflect these values. John told me about where he
lived, but also areas of the city he admires (where this text picks up). This conversation reflects
engaged Placemaking, I believe, as words like organic, belonging, and responsibility come up.
While reading it, imagine plates of chicken stew and rice and beans sitting in front of us:
✷
You wanna talk about where I want to be? More and more, especially coming to visit you and
the whole apartment up on Arden, I love Inwood. I had never known that neighborhood except
to go to the cloisters or fort tryon park maybe once every couple of years. But I had never
walked around like Dyckman street or stuff like that, and I love it so much. It’s different as a
man, because I can walk around freely at night and just enjoy the scene and everybody partying
and clubs going on, people just smoking and playing dice in the street. But I do, it’s got
character, it’s got flavor. People are out and want to be there and know their neighbors and stuff
like that. It was kind of like that in Queens and I look back and I’m like, wait a second, I know
everybody in my apartment building and there were familiar faces out on the block I would see.
And I knew them, they knew me, and we didn’t know each other’s names but we would always
say hi. You know, there was this one guy who said say hi to your dad for me. I had no idea who
he was but every time I saw him on the block walking home from high school or something, say
hi to your dad for me. If I knew who you were I would, but right now I’m just going to tell my dad
some guy said hi to you. Where I live now, especially at the Northwestern tip of Hell’s Kitchen -
it’s not even Hell’s Kitchen, it’s some weird Midtown West.
It’s the only place I’ve ever been in Manhattan that has car dealerships.
Yeah, there’s a gas station, there’s car dealerships, like what is this? There’s no storefronts. I
use the word sanitized a lot, like it’s really just sanitized. People don’t spend time there. Like you
live there in the apartments, you order your Uber eats, and you never go far from your block.
And it’s kind of just sad, you know? Even two blocks eastward, when I was on 54th and 9th, I
really liked that apartment because I could walk down the block, I was on 9th Avenue and boom
boom boom everybody’s out. And that still didn’t really have a neighborhood-y feel. When I
came up to Inwood the first couple times I was like, holy cow, it’s 3AM but people are still out
with their families, they got their picnic chairs set up, they got kids running around. Do people
sleep? This is so cool.
Yeah. And Inwood’s cool too because it has both the nightclub scene but then it also has the
part across Broadway with the nicer apartment buildings. And that has a real community feel
too. I feel like it’s a community of people who just decided that this was the place...
And they never left! They built up their neighborhood around them. As opposed to out here,
where I live now, the neighborhood was built for people by developers, wasn’t built by the
people that lived here. Nobody knew they wanted to live here until somebody put up a building
and said, “Hey, you want to live here.” That’s what Hudson Yards is! It’s inorganic, and it really
makes you feel kind of like... not out of place, but there’s no sense of belonging. There’s nothing
I owe to this neighborhood, and it’s not doing anything for me except making me crane my neck.
I don’t know any of my neighbors. I only know my doormen in my building.
No sense of ownership, I guess?
Yeah. I don’t feel any sort of that responsibility to the neighborhood. There’s nothing to gain by
me trying to put myself into something to make it better, you know? There’s a couple community
gardens that I’ve wanted to volunteer at, or spend a little time at. And there’s a really nice dog
park a few blocks away. Which I really do like that place. There’s the dog park and then there’s
a softball field next door to it, where I would play intramural softball a lot.
Actually, when you mentioned community gardens that kind of gets to another thing I’m curious
to ask about. What are some average, everyday ways that you feel like you can give back to the
places that you live in or enjoy?
Breakfast carts. I think they keep the city running in the mornings. And if I find a good breakfast
cart or a good deli around the neighborhood, I’m gonna patronize the shit out of it. I’m gonna go
there all the time. If somebody comes to visit and is like let’s get breakfast, I’m like yeah let’s go
to this one bodega on 56th and 9th where I know the guy and he knows me. Anytime I see him
I’m like, “When were you last in Mexico City?” He’s like, “Ah, six months ago. It’s very
dangerous.” Every time he tells me it’s very dangerous, don’t go. I’m like, okay thanks, won’t go!
And then I get my bacon, egg, and cheese and walk out. And we’re getting into that social
contract - or the logical extension of the social contract where if you like something about your
neighborhood, support it. Over-support it. Like this place [Lali]. I came here last week, I got
breakfast, and I was really grateful for it. I was like, wow, there’s no place to get a really quick
breakfast thing on the go, a little cup of coffee for under like seven dollars, you know? So the
lady behind the counter gives me the chicken pasteles, she gives me a cup of coffee and it’s
four bucks and I tip her the extra dollar cause I’m like, I need to support this. Like the breakfast
carts, I’ll always be tipping the guy like fifty cents, a dollar every day because it’s cheaper than
anything else I’d get in the area, and so I’d already be paying that dollar anyway. May as well go
to you. And I want you to stay. I need you around, please.
So it sounds like support the places that…?
Yeah, the businesses, the ventures. I could talk about picking up litter or something, or tending
to a community garden, but that’s not how I inhabit the spaces that I’ve lived in. I’ve always lived
in a very dense urban environment, where there’s stores. Those are peoples’ livelihoods, these
stores. So if you want to show support for people’s livelihoods and keep a neighborhood the
character you want it to be, you support stores, restaurants. And I love food, so I’m always down
to eat, and I’m always down to spend a little extra on food...
✷
This love of food happens to be something that John and I share, so from here the interview
mostly devolved into talking about that. We disagreed on the maximum price that a slice of
pizza should cost (I am willing to accept $2.50, John is irked by anything above $2). We chatted
about halal carts, and the best places to eat in Sunnyside (John’s recommendation: La Pollera
de Mario on Greenpoint Ave.).
I was happy that our conversation not only encompassed the imagining part of Placemaking,
and sharing what should be sought out in a neighborhood. It also included John’s thoughts on
how to achieve this: support for the establishments we’d like to see more of. Here’s to John’s
quest to eat at enough breakfast carts and lunch counters to save 10th Avenue! I’m sure he
would welcome help.
